Notes on [YouTube lectures](https://www.youtube.com/user/lindseykuper/videos) given by [Lindsey Kuper](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~lkuper/), Assistant Professor of Computing as UCSC

Please excuse any typos or cases where I might have given a poor summary of something Lindsey was saying...

There are no notes for lecture 1 as this was concerned with course administration and logistics.
