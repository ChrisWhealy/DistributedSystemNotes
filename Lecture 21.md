## Recap: MapReduce Phases

The functionality of the MapReduce framework is divided into three distinct phases:

* The ***Map*** phase
* The ***Shuffle*** phase
* The ***Reduce*** phase

### The Map Phase

This is where the developer's map function is applied to all the input data.  The data types going into and coming out of the map function are typically not the data type seen in the final output.

In general, the map function's input type is some identifiable unit of data that needs to be analysed and can be supplied in the form of a key/value pair: for instance, to create an inverted index of words in a Web document, the key would be the URL of that document, and the value is the document's contents.

The map function then performs whatever analysis is required on that data and outputs a list of intermediate key/value pairs.  Initially, the output of the map function is written to local storage on each map worker machine.

#### Inverted Index Example

In the previous lecture, we used the simplified example of creating an inverted index.  Here, the input to our map function was:

```
<Doc1, <the, quick, brown, fox, jumped, over, the, lazy, dog>>
```

And the output was:

```
<the, Doc1>
<quick, Doc1>
<brown, Doc1>
<fox, Doc1>
<jumped, Doc1>
<over, Doc1>
<the, Doc1>
<lazy, Doc1>
<dog, Doc1>
```

#### Word Count Example

But MapReduce is a general-purpose framework that can perform many more tasks than simply creating inverted indices.  What if we wanted to take the same document as before and count word frequency?

So, our input data is exactly the same as before:

```
<Doc1, <the, quick, brown, fox, jumped, over, the, lazy, dog>>
```

And in the simplest case, the output could be nothing more than:

```
<the, 1>
<quick, 1>
<brown, 1>
<fox, 1>
<jumped, 1>
<over, 1>
<the, 1>
<lazy, 1>
<dog, 1>
```

Here, the word `the` occurs twice in the text, but this simple case defers the addition of multiple occurrences of the same word to the reduce phase; however, should we wish to implement this optimisation in the map function, then that would be fine.  E.G.:

```
<the, 2>
<quick, 1>
<brown, 1>
...
```

#### Distributed `grep` Example

Ok, but what about distributed `grep`?<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>

```
<Doc1, <the, quick, brown, fox, jumped, over, the, lazy, dog>>
<Doc2, <i, love, my, dog, spot>>
```

How the map function chooses to structure its output data is based entirely on what sort of results you want your `grep` function to produce.  For instance, let's say we want to search for the word `dog` in the above input data.  A na√Øve implementation of `grep` would output:

```
<Doc1, dog>
<Doc2, dog>
```

But a more sophisticated implementation may include the target word's context:

```
<Doc1, <lazy, dog>>
<Doc2, <my, dog, spot>>
```

or to take things a step further, the target word's context and a list of location offsets

```
<Doc1, <context, <lazy, dog>, offset, <7>>
<Doc2, <context, <my, dog, spot>, offset, <3>>
```

The point here is that the map function produces data in the form of key/value pairs.

Usually, these key/value pairs are qualified as being ***intermediate*** because they represent some halfway point in our calculation and require further processing by the reduce function.  However, in the case of distributed `grep`, the map function has already completed the required processing, either by identifying where in the document the target pattern occurs, or by returning an empty result; thus, in this case, the reduce function could be implemented as a ***do nothing*** function that simply returns whatever value it has been passed.<sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>

### The Shuffle Phase

The shuffle phase is where all the intermediate key/value pairs created by the map workers are passed to the appropriate reduce workers for further processing.  But how do we decide which reduce worker is the right one?  This is decided by the partitioning function that implements some sort of hashing rule.

This partitioning function is supplied by the MapReduce framework and although Google doesn't exactly say ***how*** it has been implemented, they give the example that it could obey a rule such as `hash(key) mod N`, where `N` is the number of reduce workers.

As has already been pointed out, the `hash mod N` approach can introduce problems if `N` changes.  In the context of Amazon's Dynamo system, they are providing an online service that must be able to withstand unpredictable events such as sudden spikes in request volume, or hardware or network failure.  Under these circumstances, the likelihood of the number of nodes in a ring changing is high; consequently, Amazon mitigate the problems associated with changing `N` in `hash mod N` by using [consistent hashing](https://github.com/ChrisWhealy/DistributedSystemNotes/blob/master/Lecture%2019.md#consistent-hashing).

However, in the case of Google's MapReduce, they are working in an offline environment in which the size of the input dataset is known up front; therefore, if you are the developer of the map and reduce functions, you already have the necessary information to make an informed decision about how many workers you will need.  You then use these values to configure the MapReduce framework for the expected workload during your particular batch run.

So, altering the number of reduce workers during a batch run would only happen in the event of some sort of Byzantine error such as hardware failure or a network partition.  Under these circumstances, Google uses checkpointing for error recovery.  So, a changing value of `N` is not something you the developer really need to be concerned about.


### The Reduce Phase

***Q:***&nbsp;&nbsp; What data type does the reduce function work with?  
***A:***&nbsp;&nbsp; Intermediate key/value pairs

The partitioning function provided by the MapReduce framework ensures that every key/value pair whose key hashes to the same value, is sent to the same reduce worker.  In practical terms, the reduce function accepts a set of key/value pairs whose hashed key values fall within a certain range.

Conceptually however, the data type of the reduce function is a key to which has been bound a set of values.  Whether the set of values bound to this key is created by the partitioning function or by explicit functionality within the reduce function is not strictly important here.

In the case of the word count example, the various map functions might output intermediate key/values pairs such as:

```
<the, 2>
<quick, 1>
<brown, 1>
<fox, 1>
<jumped, 1>
<over, 1>
<lazy, 1>
<dog, 1>
```

The key values go through the `hash mod N` algorithm which then determines which reduce worker will handle the next phase of the processing.  The output of a single reduce worker might then be the sum of all the word count totals received from the various map workers:

```
<the, 12>
<brown, 2>
<fox, 6>
<lazy, 4>
```

What about the distributed `grep` example?

In this case, each map worker either locates the search text in the document or it does not.  So, by the time we pass the results to the reduce function, the required processing has ***already*** been done.  So, the reduce function does not need to do anything other than write its input data directly to the output storage (GFS, for instance).

This turns out to be quite a common pattern: the reduce function is implemented as little more than the identity function (see endnote [2](#f2)).


## Handling Map Worker Failure

One detail we left out of the previous discussion was the use of a ***master*** process.  This process acts as the supervisor or scheduler for the work performed by all the workers.

The master periodically pings each of the workers and if they do not respond within a given timeout period, assumes that they have failed in some way.<sup id="a3">[3](#f3)</sup>

![MapReduce Master 1](./img/L21%20Master%201.png)

So, let's say that map worker `M1` now fails:

![MapReduce Master 2](./img/L21%20Master%202.png)

***Q:***&nbsp;&nbsp; What's happened to all the work `M1` was doing?  Is it lost or can it be salvaged?  
***A:***&nbsp;&nbsp; Hmmmm, since `M1` is now unreachable, all of its work is also unreachable; therefore, it will have to be redone... :-(

Since map workers fail from time to time, what's the best way of handling this failure?  To answer this, Google had to examine the cost of the design options:

***Option 1)***  
Ensure that every map worker writes its intermediate key/value pairs not to its local disk (that would become inaccessible in the event of failure), but to some external location from where it can be recovered

***Option 2)***  
Risk having to redo all the work assigned to a map worker if that worker fails

The answer here is simply one of time &mdash; on average, which option will be quicker?

Option 1 means that the time penalty of writing data over the network must be paid on every ***successful*** run of a map worker.

Option 2 means that occasionally, we will have to pay a time penalty in order to redo a map worker's entire workload; however, since map workers are successful far more often than they fail, this penalty is not paid very often.

In general fault tolerance in distributed systems requires us to duplicate something.  So, in practice, we end up duplicating some combination of:

* ***Data***: by storing multiple copies
* ***Communication***: by sending multiple messages
* ***Computation (Effort)***: by occasionally having to redo some work

One of the distinguishing features of MapReduce is that it deliberately chooses to redo work in the event of worker failure because on average, this incurs a smaller time penalty than transferring data over the network.


## Combine Functions

Let's look at the word count example again.  Say we want to search for the word `dog` in the string:

```
My dog Spot is the best dog and the fastest dog
```

A na√Øve approach would be to scan the text and every time the target word is located, output an individual hit, resulting in:

```
<dog, 1>
<dog, 1>
<dog, 1>
```

But the downside of this is that three, identical intermediate key/value pairs must now be sent over the network to the reduce worker.  It would be far more efficient to derive a subtotal within the map function and then send only one intermediate key/value pair over the wire.

```
<dog, 3>
```

This job is performed by a ***combine function***.

A combine function performs a task very similar to that of the reduce function, but it runs inside the map worker in order to perform local optimisation.  This is perfectly valid because the overall task we're performing is associative.  `a + b` is the same as `b + a`, so the order in which additions are performed is immaterial.

So, generally speaking, if your MapReduce task is associative, then perform as much work in the map function as possible.  This has two advantages:

* It can significantly reduce the quantity of data that needs to be transferred during the shuffle phase
* The reduce function runs much faster because (in this case) it only needs to add up subtotals, rather than all the individual values discovered by the map functions.

## Map and Reduce Function Types

### Map Function

The map function needs two arguments:

1. A function that performs the required transformation on a single list item, and
1. A list of items to be transformed

The MapReduce framework then works its way down the list, passing every element in turn to your Map function and storing the results in a new list.

The datatypes used by the map function would be written like this in Haskell:

```haskell
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
```

Breaking this down:

* `map :: (a -> b)` means that the first argument to `map` is a function.  This function takes an input of type `a` and returns an output of type `b`
* `-> [a]` means that the second argument to `map` is a list in which all the items are of type `a`
* `-> [b]` at the end means that the final result is of type `b`

This function would then be implemented as follows:

```haskell
map _ [] = []
map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs
```

So here, we have described how `map` should behave in two situations.  The first is:

```haskell
map _ [] = []
```

Here, if map is passed an empty list `[]`, then all we will do is respond with another empty list `[]`.  The underscore after `map` means that in the case of receiving an empty list, we don't care what type of function is supplied, because that function isn't going to be called anyway...  This is known as the ***base case*** and serves the vital role of terminating the recursive calls to the `map` function.

The second case is more interesting because this is where `map` is passed a non-empty list:

```haskell
map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs
```

The first argument passed to `map` is a function called `f`, and second argument is the list of items over which `f` will be mapped.  This list is destructured into the variables `x` and `xs`, where `x` contains whatever value is found at the head of the list, and `xs` contains whatever else is left in the tail.

We then call function `f` passing it `x` as an argument and concatenate what we get back to the result of recursively calling `map` passing in function `f` and whatever is left over in `xs`.

This is how we can recursively call function `f` on the elements in the ever-decreasing list `xs`.  For each call to `f`, `xs` becomes one element smaller and eventually becomes the empty list.  At this point we have hit our base case and recursion terminates because the list has been fully processed.

So, a simple example would be:

```haskell
map increment [1,2,3] = [2,3,4]
```

### Reduce Function

In some programming languages, `reduce` is also known as `foldr` meaning *"fold the values in the list towards the right"*.

Whereas a map function needed two arguments, a reduce function needs three:

1. A function that does the reducing,
1. Some starting (or base) value, and
1. A list of values that need to be reduced

In Haskell, this type would be declared like this:

```haskell
reduce :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
```

Breaking this down:

* `reduce :: (a -> b -> b)` means that the first argument to `reduce` is a function.  This function takes a value of type `a` and a value of type `b` and gives back a value of type `b`.
* `-> b` means that `reduce` also takes second value of type `b`
* `-> [a]` means that `reduce` also takes a third value that is a list of values of type `a`
* `-> b`  at the end means the overall value returned by `reduce` is of type `b`

So how do we run the function passed to `reduce`?  This function needs two arguments; a value of type `a` that comes from whatever list we're reducing, and a value of type `b`.  But what is this value of type `b`?  This value is known variously as the *"identity value"* or the *"base value"* or simply the *"accumulator"*, and acts as a starting value.

In the case that we are trying to reduce an empty list, then whatever value is supplied as the identity or base value is simply returned unmodified.  Traditionally, the value supplied as the base case is known as the *"zero"* value, hence the `z` in the code sample below;

```haskell
reduce _ z [] = z
```

As with the base case of the `map` function, the underscore here means that when `reduce` is passed an empty list, we couldn't care less about what type of function we've been supplied, because it's never going to be called anyway!  So, all we do is give back the initial zero value `z`.

In the case where `reduce` is passed a list:

```haskell
reduce f z (x:xs) = f x (reduce f z xs)
```

We call function `f` passing in the first value from the list (destructured into variable `x` which is of type `a`), but from where do we get the value of type `b`?  Well, we know that the `reduce` function gives us back a value of type `b`, so we recursively call `reduce` on the tail of the list (destructured into variable `xs`) and use whatever value it returns as the required value of type `b`.

So, a simple example of the word count reduce function looks like this:

```haskell
reduce add 0 [1,1,2,1,] = 5
```
